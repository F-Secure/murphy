Heavy refactor on the web workbench, moving stuff to more adecuated directories, usage of requirejs on the javascript side and so
Several small bugfixes all around
Added new model creation from workbench itself, still in an early stage and has known issues (like project names with dots are not supported)
Added initial dismantler view, again, very early preview
Modified how uac prompts are scraped, however a lot of more work is needed
Live preview window, vnc links and few other minor additions
