<h3>Murphy is experimental software</h3>
And it will continue to be for the foreseable future.<br>
It was born as an experiment of trying to automate test automation activities, without a clear idea or direction and many experiments happened inside of it.
While many things can be done with it most of the features are still in an early stage, internal API's will change and so too the features it contains.<br>
<h3>It is in alpha stage</h3>
So you probably dont want to use it in a production environment unless you feel adventurous and can hack, fix and adapt the code of it.<br>
You can play with it, you can help building it, you can try out ideas but I wont recommend to compromise a deadline while using it, you have been warned.<br> 
<h3>It (is?) well documented</h3>
If you believe developers when they say that 'the documentation is the code' :)<br>
There's very little documentation and most things needs to be figured out from the code, which is
not in great shape, as one experiment lead to another and so... well... it is in need of some major refactoring.<br>
<h3>Today is here, tomorrow who knows...</h3>
There's no long term commitment on it, I've spend close to a year developing the basic concepts and used it extensively inside F-Secure, there's will to enhance
and expand it's capabilities at least for now, hopefully it will generate enough synergy that will support further investment.<br>
<h3>If it didn't scare you yet</h3>
Gotta say, it was a really interesting trip to develop it. There are many amusing things that can be done on top of it, some partially working experiments in the pipeline:<br>
<ul>
<li>Privilege elevation support (for example in the middle of the exploration windows asks for permissions for allowing something)</li>
<li>Web pages / web application support</li>
<li>Android support</li>
</ul>
Other experiments:<br>
<ul>
<li>Interface to test case generation based on the extracted model</li>
<li>Simple record and playback interface for simple tests</li>
<li>Fully customizable crawler for extensive exploration</li>
<li>Event generators for crawler, for example try an action with the network activated, but also try with the network deactivated</li>
<li>Usability assesments, for example automatic recording of how long each action took</li>
<li>Look & feel whatif, since the UI can be reconstructed from the model, a nice proof of concept was developed that allowed to see the whole application with different 'skins'</li>
<li>Many more...</li>
</ul>
<h3>What murphy is NOT</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is not a replacement for your test automation, is a complement</li>
<li>Is not a replacement for manual testing, is a complement and helper tool</li>
<li>Is not magic thingy that will solve the world hunger problem, it may help you to test more and better</li>
</ul>
