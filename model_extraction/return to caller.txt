Popups or modal dialogs can be reused, for example an exit confirmation dialog that can be prompted from different places

For reducing the overall complexity of the model it is desirable to parametrize them instead of handling as separate
nodes on the graph, this poses some challenges.

An edge can be "return_to_caller='Yes'" as to inform that this edge returns to the node who was active before
the node with such edge, for example:
Node "Confirmation Dialog"
    edge "Yes" -> "Clean Machine"
    edge "No" -> "Welcome Dialog" (return_to_caller='Yes')
    edge "No (2)" -> "Installation Dialog" (return_to_caller='Yes')
    
In the given example, the 2nd edge is valid only if "Confirmation Dialog" node was entered thru an edge of
the "Welcome Dialog" node.
Same logic applies to the edge "No (2)", is valid only if "Confirmation Dialog" node was entered thru an edge of
the "Installation Dialog" node

This extra bit of information allows simple path validation for such edges for those 'reusable' dialogs

There are more complex scenarios that go beyond simple popup/modal dialogs that are not handled at the moment

Discovery of those 'return to caller' edges can be time consuming, for automatically detect them a node has
to be enter and exited thru all the possible combinations of entry/exit routes to confirm if it is the case.

For now, no attempt will be done to try detect them automatically but there's interest to add it in the future,
instead for now they'll be manually created.
At this very moment, accidentally discovered ones are created automatically.
